## Problem Description

Given an array with N distinct elements, convert the given array to a form where all elements are in the range from 0 to N-1. 

The order of elements is the same, i.e., 0 is placed in the place of the smallest element, 1 is placed for the second smallest element, â€¦ N-1 is placed for the largest element.
