# Daily DSA Practice

This repository is focused on daily problem-solving in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. The goal is to solve one problem each day, covering a wide range of topics to strengthen problem-solving skills and improve coding proficiency.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Each day's problem is organized in separate folders:

- `DayX/` (e.g., `Day1/`, `Day2/`, etc.)
  - **`Problem.md`**: Contains the description of the DSA problem.
  - **`Solution.java`**: The Java implementation of the solution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topics Covered

This repository covers a variety of DSA topics, including but not limited to:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing
