# Sort Colors (LeetCode 75)

## Problem Description

Given an array `arr` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the colors:
- `0`: Red
- `1`: White
- `2`: Blue

### Constraints:
- You must solve this problem **without using the library's sort function**.

### Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
    Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

### Example 2:
    Input: nums = [2,0,1]
    Output: [0,1,2]
